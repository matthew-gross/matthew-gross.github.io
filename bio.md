title: About Me
---

I grew up in New York City during the rise of the New York Yankees dynasty of the 1990s. I attended the University of Michigan where I graduated with a B.A. in economics in 2010. After college, I moved to Washington D.C. to work for the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant. After sweating profusely for 3 years straight, I moved back to Ann Arbor to begin my PHd in economics.

I can be found quarantining in New York city, watching movies, riding my bike or playing basketball.
