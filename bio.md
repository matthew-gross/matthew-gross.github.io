title: About Me
---

I am originally from New York City where I developed my interest in cities and urban policy. After high school, I attended the University of Michigan, graduating with a B.A. in economics in 2010. Next, I moved to Washington D.C. to work for the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant in the Consumer Research section. Despite learning to cope with the Washington D.C. summers, I was excited to move back to Michigan in 2014 to pursure my Ph.D. in economics.

I am mostly interested in applied microeconomics topics with policy relevance. In addition, I am interested in learning about and utilizing new methods to faciliatate my research. I have experience working with and analyzing data from a variety of sources including restricted government surveys such as the Decennial Census and American Community Survey, criminal justice data from numerous jurisdictions, publicly available government surveys such as the Survey of Consumer Finances and much more.

When I am not working, I can be found social-distancing in New York city, watching movies, riding my bike or playing basketball. I am a fan of most New York sports teams and all Michigan Wolverine teams. I have created and curated a ranking of over 900 movies that I have watched over the years. If you ask, I would be happy to tell you about the 18 films that are closest to achieving movie perfection.
